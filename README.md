# Experiment: NEWMAN 64
This is a mostly complete decompilation of the Windows build of [Experiment: NEWMAN 64](https://futureprimitive.itch.io/experiment-newman-64) Patch #1.

Use Godot 4.2.1 to open this project.

## Known issues
### real builds
- the icons for objects that you can pick up with a glove do not show up (this causes the game to crash while loading levels with those objects in RELEASE builds)
- dialogue is broken
### the whole decomp (real builds + editor builds)
- the lighting looks off
### All types of builds (decomp builds and official builds, but not editor builds)
- jacks do not spawn in flying fortress
